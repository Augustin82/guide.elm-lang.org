# Installation

We have come a long way without installing anything! We learned **The Elm Architecture**. We learned about **types**. We learned how to interact with the outside world through **commands** and **subscriptions**. Things are going well, but we need to get Elm working on your computer for the next couple sections!

The next two pages will show how to get Elm working in your **editor** and then in your **terminal**.


## Motivation

I have worked hard to make the next two pages go smoothly, but it is always possible to run into trouble when installing things. So here are two angles to help you through if something goes wrong!

**Motivation 1:** Installation will set us up to learn about:

- JavaScript interop
- Projects that have many files
- Architecture strategies for larger projects
- "Single-Page Applications"
- Optimization

These topics will help you create more complex personal projects and eventually get things going at work!

**Motivation 2:** If you run into any trouble, please ask about it in a [community forum](https://elm-lang.org/community)! Talking through an install problem can usually save you a lot of time, and people are happy to help out. Please ask for help!
